
exp.zip contains all files.

----------

Run flex, bison, and compile by writing the following on the command line:

  make -f Makefile

To run, write the following on the command line:

  ./exp

Now you can type an expression ended by $ and <Ctrl>-D.
Example (leaving out the <Ctrl>-D):

  3*4-1/x$

  NOTE:

  assign a variable, e.g.: var a:int; a=3;
  followed by any operation causes an error, don't know why this is

example for replication:

 var a:int;
 a=3;
 func test(c:int):int
 write 2;
 return 1;
 end test;
 write 2;
